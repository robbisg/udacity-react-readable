# Readable - Udacity's React Fundamentals ND Project #2
This is my solution for the second project of the Udacity's React Fundamental Nanodegree.

## Description
The App is a blog application to interact with several users, without any authentication.

## Installation
The App is build in React and uses [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/), [React Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux) and [Redux](http://redux.js.org) for the architecture, and  [Material-UI](http://www.material-ui.com/#/) and [React Flexbox Grid] (https://roylee0704.github.io/react-flexbox-grid/) for the style, but you can find dependencies in the package.json file.
To install and run the app follow these steps:

```
# Clone the project
git clone https://github.com/robbisg/udacity-react-readable my-reads
cd my-reads

# Install dependecies
npm install

# Start the App
npm start
```

Now you can go to http://localhost:3000 and find your virtual bookshelf!

You can check further details in the main [Udacity's React git repository](https://github.com/udacity/)
